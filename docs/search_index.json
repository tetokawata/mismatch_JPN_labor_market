We use the Referentials and Placements by Prefecture, Employment Referral Statistics, which reports monthly numbers of vacancy, job seekers, and new employment. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Method", " Chapter 2 Method Apply the mismatch index proposed by Şahin et al. (2014). The mismatch index, \\(M_t\\), is defined as \\[M_t = \\frac{h_t^{*}-h_t}{h_t},\\] where \\(h_t\\) and \\(h_t^*\\) are actual and counter-factual numbers of new employment, respectively. The counter-factual numbers is a solution of planner problem. The planner problem is to maximize the number of new employment, given the making function \\(\\mu_{jt}(u_{jt},v_{jt})\\), the number of vacancy \\(v_{jt}\\), and the total number of job seeker \\(u_{t}\\). Formally, \\[h_t^*=\\max_{u_{jt}} \\sum_j h_{jt},\\] subject to \\[h_{jt}=\\mu_{jt}(u_{jt},v_{jt}),\\ \\ \\ \\ (matching\\ function)\\] and \\[\\sum_{j}u_{jt}=u_t.\\ \\ \\ \\ (Resource\\ constrint)\\] The estimation process is follows Suppose a parametric specification on the matching function as \\(\\mu_{jt}(u_{jt},v_{jt})=A_{jt}u_{jt}^{1-\\beta}v_{jt}^{\\beta}\\), where \\(A_{jt}=exp(f_t,f_j,\\epsilon_{jt})\\), \\(f_t\\) and \\(f_j\\) are time and sector fixed-effects, respectively. The parametric assumption obtains the closed solution of the planner problem; \\[h_t^*=\\max_{u_{jt}} \\sum_j exp(f_t,f_j,\\epsilon_{jt})\\times v_{jt}^{\\beta}\\times (u_{jt}^*)^{1-\\beta},\\] where \\[u_{jt}^*=\\frac{A_{jt}^{1/\\beta}v_{jt}}{\\sum_{j&#39;}A_{j&#39;t}^{1/\\beta}v_{j&#39;t}}u_{t}.\\ \\ \\ \\ (optimal\\ allocation)\\] Estimate the log-transfer matching function \\[\\log(h_{jt}/u_{jt})=f_{j}+f_{t}+\\beta\\times\\log(v_{jt}/u_{jt})+\\epsilon_{jt}.\\] Calculate the mismatch index with estimated parameters in Step 2.
